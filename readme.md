# CryptoCards Backend

## Synopsis

[WIP] CryptoCards is a game centered around unique playing cards which you can battle against other players. Each card is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.  

CryptoCards is built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org).

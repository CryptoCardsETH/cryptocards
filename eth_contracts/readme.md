# CryptoCards Contracts

## Synopsis

[WIP] CryptoCards is a game centered around unique playing cards which you can battle against other players. Each card is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.  

CryptoCards Contracts are build with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) using [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), as well as the [Truffle Development Framework](http://truffleframework.com).
